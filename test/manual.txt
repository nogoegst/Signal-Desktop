Manual test script

Some things are very difficult to test programmatically. Also, if you don't have adequate test coverage, a good first step is a comprehensive manual test script! https://blog.scottnonnenberg.com/web-application-test-strategy/

Conversation view:
  Last seen indicator:
    - Make window small, switch away from conversation, receive messages that would more than fill up the window, switch back to conversation: the 'N unread messages' text should be at the top of the window, most recent message should be off-screen. You should see a highlighted scroll down button in the bottom-right.
      (do this with conversation already loaded and with conversation not previously loaded )
    - Receive more messages while this is showing - the number should increment, and the window should not scroll
    - Scroll to the bottom of the window, receive more messages - each message should scroll the window down, so the latest message stays at the bottom of the window.
    - Increase the size of the window so that the 'N unread messages' text is showing. It should reflect the total count of messages below it
    - Send a message, and the 'N unread messages' text should disappear
    - Switch conversations, receive messages while not displaying conversation
    - Switch back to conversation, and the 'N unread messages' text should show
    - Switch away from conversation and back, the scroll position should be the same but the 'N unread messages' text should not be showing
    - Receive message while showing conversation - no 'N unread messages' text should appear

  Scrolling:
    - If scrolled to bottom of a conversation, should stay there when a new message comes in
    - If scrolled to the middle of a conversation, should stay there when a new message comes in
    - When you've scrolled up an entire screen's worth, a scroll down button in the bottom right should appear`

  Scroll-down button:
    - Clicking it takes you to the bottom of the conversation, makes the button disappear
    - If a new message comes in while it is already showing, it highlights (darker in light them, lighter in dark theme)
    - If a new message comes in while not at the bottom of the converstation (but buttin is not already showing), it should appear in highlighted form
